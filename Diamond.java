 //Input//

    //Odd (Every odd diamond starts with a single *). The amount of space you get until you get to the middle.//
    //is 1 less than the previous line & starts to decrease again after the middle until 1.//
    //3/2= 1 (with a remainder of 1 which is removed example) or 7/2=3 (with a remainder of 1 which is removed).//

    //Print Output//

    //Even//

    //Print Output//

    //Test//

      //Sequence//
        //Single Selection//
         //(If) (example: If raining outside = take umbrella) (example: If not raining outside = ignore all together)
          //True or False Statement, If you need more than 1 statement subordinate to the if statement use
          // {}, example:
            //if (raining outside){
              // take umbrella;
              // take raincoat;
              //}
    //A%B = A for all A<B  % is called modulo or mod.
    //Repetition:
      //For loop: for(int x = 0; x < 3; x++)
      //                System.out.println("x");
      //While loop:
      //Do... while:
    // Keep count of spaces, and asterisks
    // i/2 = # of spaces on the first line
    // If you hold the variable (i/2)-1 (applies until the middle)
    // If you hold the variable (i/2)+1 (applies after the middle)
    // For the even case it's top and bottom line is treated differently than the rest.
